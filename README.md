## Here are the some useful examples

#### PHP OOP design patterns
- There are several design patterns in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that can be applied in PHP, including:
    * Factory pattern: This pattern provides a way to create objects without specifying the exact class of object that will be created.

    * Singleton pattern: This pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.

    * Observer pattern: This pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

    * Decorator pattern: This pattern dynamically adds or overrides behavior to an individual object, either statically or dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class.

    * Adapter pattern: This pattern converts the interface of a class into another interface that clients expect. It lets classes work together that couldn't otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.

    * Strategy pattern: This pattern enables selecting an algorithm at runtime, by defining a family of algorithms, encapsulating each one, and making them interchangeable.

    * Facade pattern: This pattern provides a simplified interface to a complex system of classes, making it easier to use.

    * Command pattern: This pattern decouples an object making a request from the one that knows how to perform it.

    * Template method pattern: This pattern defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, deferring some steps to subclasses.

    * Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern: This pattern separates the application logic into three interconnected components: the model, the view, and the controller.
